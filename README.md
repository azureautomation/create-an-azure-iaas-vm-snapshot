Create an Azure IaaS VM Snapshot
================================

            

This is a script that I use to take snapshots on my Azure IaaS VMs  This script takes a bit to run due to all of the things that have to be done to get a BLOB copy of an Azure VM but it works great!  I've tested this on a few of my Azure VMs with
 no problems.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
